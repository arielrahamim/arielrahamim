👋 Hi there! I'm Ariel Rahamim
📚 Over the last year, I've been studying and immersing myself in various aspects of DevOps and cloud technologies, broadening my skills and knowledge. 

Here are some of the key areas I've delved into:

🐧 Learning the ins and outs of Linux, a fundamental skill for any DevOps engineer.
🐳 Exploring the world of containers and mastering Docker to containerize applications for easier deployment and scaling.
☁️ Diving into cloud computing, where I achieved the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification
🚀 Navigating the Kubernetes universe, and I'm proud to say that I'm a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA).
🔄 building and optimizing CI/CD pipelines to accelerate software delivery, streamlining the development process and ensuring reliable, consistent deployments.
🌐 Embracing Infrastructure as Code (IAC) with Terraform, automating infrastructure provisioning and management.

I'm genuinely passionate about DevOps principles and the power of automation, especially the declarative approach, which I find incredibly cool for defining the desired state of infrastructure and applications, ensuring consistency and scalability.

Beyond the tech realm, you can often find me gaming my way through exciting virtual worlds and escaping into the captivating stories of manga. Let's connect, collaborate, and geek out over DevOps, cloud tech, gaming, or any other fascinating topic that ignites our interest!
